This implementation is using the fatfs-library for writing on the sd-card (http://elm-chan.org/).
To use this library, the sd-card-controller or spi layer has to be implemented in the file diskio.cpp. One example is in /filesystem/bare-metal/raspberrypi/.
It is possible to send various commands via the fatfs library to the sd-card. These Commands have to be implemented in the diskio.cpp, too.

The possible commands that the sd-card-controller can handle are listed below:

Important sd-card commands:
Command	Argument	Data	Abbreviation		Description
CMD0	None(0)		No	GO_IDLE_STATE		Software reset.
CMD1	None(0)		No	SEND_OP_COND		Initiate initialization process.
ACMD41 	 		No	APP_SEND_OP_COND	For only SDC. Initiate initialization process.
CMD8	 		No	SEND_IF_COND		For only SDC V2. Check voltage range.
CMD9	None(0)		Yes	SEND_CSD		Read CSD register.
CMD10	None(0)		Yes	SEND_CID		Read CID register.
CMD12	None(0)		No	STOP_TRANSMISSION	Stop to read data.
CMD16	Block length 	No	SET_BLOCKLEN		Change R/W block size.
CMD17	Address[31:0]	Yes	READ_SINGLE_BLOCK	Read a block.
CMD18	Address[31:0]	Yes	READ_MULTIPLE_BLOCK	Read multiple blocks.
CMD23	Num. of blocks 	No	SET_BLOCK_COUNT		For only MMC. Define number of blocks to transfer with next multi-block read/write command.
ACMD23 	Num. of blocks	No	SET_WR_BLOCK_ERASE_COUNT For only SDC. Define number of blocks to pre-erase with next multi-block write command.
CMD24	Address[31:0]	Yes	WRITE_BLOCK		Write a block.
CMD25	Address[31:0]	Yes	WRITE_MULTIPLE_BLOCK	Write multiple blocks.
CMD55 	None(0)		No	APP_CMD			Leading command of ACMD<n> command.
CMD58	None(0)		No	READ_OCR		Read OCR.
