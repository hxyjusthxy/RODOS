This port uses:
UART            for stdout via xprintf/PRINTF -> can be changed in params.h
Timer 2         for RODOS time base
SysTick Timer   for preemption
40kB RAM        for Thread stacks -> can be changed in params.h

During startup is used:
Timer 5         for Watchdog init -> can be used after hwInit() (see hw_specific.cpp for details on redefining ISR)

TODO: free Timer 2 -> use also SysTick timer for RODOS time base
